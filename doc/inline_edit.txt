INSTALLATION                                          *inline-edit-installation*

There are several ways to install the plugin. The recommended one is by using
Tim Pope's pathogen (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332). In
that case, you can clone the plugin's git repository like so:
>
    git clone git://github.com/AndrewRadev/inline_edit.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/inline_edit
<
If your vim configuration is under git version control, you could also set up
the repository as a submodule, which would allow you to update more easily.
The command is (provided you're in ~/.vim):
>
    git submodule add git://github.com/AndrewRadev/inline_edit.vim.git bundle/inline_edit
<
Another way is to simply copy all the essential directories inside the ~/.vim
directory: plugin, autoload, doc.

After the plugin is installed, the command |:InlineEdit| will attempt to
locate the area to edit and then open up a temporary buffer to edit only that
area. To make this more comfortable to do often, it's recommended to create a
mapping that calls it. For example:
>
    " normal mode:
    nnoremap <leader>e :InlineEdit<cr>

    " visual mode:
    xnoremap <leader>e :InlineEdit<cr>

    " insert mode:
    inoremap <c-e> <esc>:InlineEdit<cr>a

Note that these examples use the current |mapleader|.


==============================================================================
USAGE                                                        *inline-edit-usage*

The idea of this plugin is to enable isolated editing of a specific area of a
buffer. This could be used for editing javascript within HTML, for example:

>
    <head>
      <script type="text/javascript">
        alert("OK");
      </script>
    </head>
<
Now, executing the command |:InlineEdit| when the cursor is within the
<script> tag would open a split with a temporary buffer with the contents of
the script tag. Editing and saving this proxy buffer would update the original
one. If |g:inline_edit_autowrite| is set to 1, the original buffer will be
saved as well.

The plugin works for various different constructs. If you're interested in
extending its functionality to fit your own needs, see |inline-edit-extending|
below. If you think of a nice one that might be useful to other people, feel
free to suggest adding it to the plugin in the github issue tracker:
https://github.com/AndrewRadev/inline_edit.vim/issues

Here's what the plugin currently works for out of the box:

Javascript and CSS within HTML ~
>
  <head>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      $(document).ready(function() {
        alert('OK');
      })
    </script>

    <style>
      body {
        color: blue;
        background-color: red;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
<

SQL within ruby (matches "<<-SQL") ~
>
    def some_heavy_query
      execute <<-SQL
        SELECT * FROM users WHERE something = 'other';
      SQL
    end
<

Ruby code within markdown blocks ~
>
    Some text.

    ``` ruby
    def foo
      puts "OK"
    end
    ```

    Some other text.
<

Blocks in django templates ~
>
    <body>
      {% block content %}
      <h1>{{ section.title }}</h1>
      {% endblock %}
    </body>
<

Visual Mode ~

If you'd like to work on an area that's not very well definable, |:InlineEdit|
also works in visual mode. Selecting an area of the code and executing
:InlineEdit will open up a proxy buffer with that area.


==============================================================================
SETTINGS                                                  *inline-edit-settings*

These are the variables that control the behaviour of the plugin.

                                                 *b:inline_edit_autowrite*
>
    let b:inline_edit_autowrite = 0
<

Default value: 0

If this variable is set to 1, writing the temporary proxy buffer would also
write the original buffer to its file. If it's 0, the original buffer will be
modified, but not saved.


==============================================================================
EXTENDING                                                *inline-edit-extending*
                                                        *g:inline_edit_patterns*

The variable |g:inline_edit_patterns| is a list of dictionaries. Extending the
plugin to work for new patterns is a simple matter of adding entries to it.
Each entry in the list can have one of two formats.


Simple ~
>
    call add(g:inline_edit_patterns, {
        \ 'main_filetype':     'vim',
        \ 'sub_filetype':      'vim',
        \ 'indent_adjustment': 1,
        \ 'start':             '\<function\>',    " required
        \ 'end':               '\<endfunction\>', " required
        \ })
<
The dictionary can contain several items, but the only two required ones are
"start" and "end". They should be regular expressions that are used to find
the margins of the area to edit. The other entries are as follows:

    - main_filetype:

      This pattern will only be attempted in the given filetype. This makes
      sense to set for most patterns. You probably don't want to open up
      javascript <script> tags in vimscript, for example.

      This is parsed as a regular expression, so you could set it to, for
      example, "html\|eruby\|php" and have the related patterns work across
      those three filetypes.

    - sub_filetype:

      This is the new filetype to set to the proxy buffer. If it's omitted,
      the original buffer's filetype is used.

    - indent_adjustment:

      Setting it to "1" will indent the proxy buffer's contents 1 indentation
      level more than the surrounding patterns. If it's "2", it will be two
      levels, and so on. The default is 0, which means that the contents of
      the proxy buffer will be indented with the level of the delimiting
      patterns (the end pattern, to be precise).


Callback ~

>
    call add(g:inline_edit_patterns, {
        \ 'main_filetype': 'textile',
        \ 'callback':      'InlineEditTextileBuffer',
        \ })
<
If the dictionary contains a "callback" key, its value will be assumed to be a
function and will be called as a function with no parameters. The result needs
to be a list of four values in this order:
    - start line
    - end line
    - filetype to set
    - indent level to set

This is much more complicated, since the function needs to search for the area
of interest itself and simply return its start and end. It's also more
flexible, since it allows for dynamically changing targets. Take a look at the
function inline_edit#MardkownFencedCode() in "autoload/inline_edit.vim" for
inspiration.

If the callback function fails to find the area, it should return an empty
dictionary.
